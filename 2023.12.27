Know the basics of 'Harmonic Drive', and then I know about the basics of 'How the bicycle gears works', through which I learned the concept of 'gear ratio' and reviewed bearings and gears. I know two very important formulars: Linear velocity = angular velocity * radius. Torque multiplied by angular velocity equals power. Torque equals force multiplied by the distance perpendicular to the direction of the force.
For English, I learned the phrasal verb 'wrap your brain around', which means understanding or coming to grips with a concept that is difficult, complex, or unfamiliar. I also gripped with 'shape up to be' and 'line up, laterally, zero backlash, cam' in mechanical context.
